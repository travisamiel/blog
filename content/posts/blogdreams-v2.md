# Goals, modeling

Where I see myself contributing to this world is in modeling.

## Open Source
What I've loved since I was 14, starting with this film [Rip! A Remix Manifesto](???), leading me to the writings and Cory Doctorow...and falling in love with the idea of commons, creative commons, literal commons, etc

## I Want

i want my blog to model good accessibility,

i want my blog to model sharing information and longer thoughts.

i want my blog to model ownership of your words and distribution.

i want my blog to show that platforms should be ambivalent and easy to leave.

our ideas should be free to read and free to share.

i want my blog to be a vessel for me to find community.

i want my blog to inspire you to use a sticky notes style app because i find it so helpful in my day to day to quickly (by clicking on the app's icon or maybe with a keyboard shortcut) record the ideas that come to you but can't be dealt with in that moment.
