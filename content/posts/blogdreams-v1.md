Sometimes I wake in the middle of the night thinking I've figured out exactly how to make this blog perfect.

Right now I like that it's built on Hugo and that it most importantly lives in little Markdown files that I own in a simple format and if I want to change the theme or host the blog somewhere else I can do that without any problems.

But then I come across a site like this https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/english.html, and I spiral and I want to redo it all.

What I would like some more of from this blog in its current state is a solid RSS feed, an easy way to have someone subscribe, and a little form at the bottom that asks people to respond if they've enjoyed the blog.
