I deeply love [Lifehacker's 'How I Work' series](https://lifehacker.com/c/how%20i%20work), and wanted to write my own recap of the software & platforms I love.

My goal is to use as much open-source software, and after reading [this series on Gizmodo](https://gizmodo.com/i-cut-the-big-five-tech-giants-from-my-life-it-was-hel-1831304194), I'm wondering how I can utilize platforms that don't have nefarious goalsâ€”I'm not perfect at all.

## My essentials

***Firefox** for web browsing, and I search with Duck Duck Go.

**Evernote** is my extension of the brain, where *everything* is stored.

**Feedly** gives me a steady stream of my favorite websites organized in chronological order, and **Pocket** allows me to read these articles on the go via my Kobo eReader.

**Todoist** is the most straightforward todo app, and I love it.

## Tools to make things

**Photopea** really gets the job done for quick editing.

**DaVinci Resolve** makes a lot of sense, and I really enjoy using it to edit videos.

**Sonic Pi** is a blast for making sounds. 

**Wick Editor** is a surpringly simple and robust animation/game-making platform.

[And then I was Like](https://andtheniwaslike.co/) comes in handy when I quickly need a GIF via my webcam.

I'm writing all of this in **Visual Studio Code**.

## Helpful Platforms

Glitch is so much fun for making digital projects.
