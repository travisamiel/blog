I am making kombucha.
(a SCOBY from a neighbor + black tea)

I am making pickles.
(cucumbers in a jar with salt)

After more than a week of letting each vessle do it's thing, I moved the jar of kombucha into a bottle (for the second stage of brewing), and I ate a what can now be called a pickle.

The kombucha was flat and still too sweet.
The pickle was mushy, and not quite bitter.

I will continue to let them do their thing, and taste again.

Stay tuned.

It's possible, I will give up. But perhaps I shouldn't, as this is ... an experiment ... something new I'm learning!
