## Preface

I am of the conviction that podcasts are not in any way a new thing. I think of podcasts as a genre of distribution whereby an [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) feed serves up (usually) audio files. i.e. the producer offers a list/menu of files, along with information, and you are able to *download* the actual fileâ€”and the menu is in a standardized, agreed-upon format so reading the menu is clear to developers. This is mode of distribution is different than streaming video/audio online or tuning into a broadcast on radio/TV. When you have the audio file you can reproduce it easily, share it, put it on any device, and keep it for as long as you want, which is quite amazing when the standard practice is that podcasts are free.

The tools to create and distribute podcasts are not currently governed by any one tech company. The standard right now (in my experience) is to have a podcast added on various directories so that where people search for podcasts (whether on apps from Apple or Google or Spotify or Stitcher or whatever), it will be there. Podcasts as a phenomenon are produced on so many topics, by so many different people, from perspectives that already have been heard, and those with less visibility throughout the world. So my point is: **whatever stereotypes you have of podcasts, toss them**.

Below are my recommendations for podcasts to listen to that I really really love, sorted by genre, followed by some further thoughts.

I hope my descriptions lead you to trying at least one episode from one of these.

## Non-fiction
Both of these podcasts I'd recommend listening to from beginning to end.

[This Land](https://crooked.com/podcast-series/this-land/): a history of the displacement and disregard of native people by the US Government, through the story of the 2020 Supreme Court case McGirt v Oklahoma.

[Derailed](https://www.wpr.org/derailed): the history of the persuit and eventual sabotage of building a high-speed train from Madison and Milwaukee.

## Interviewing
I love hearing a good interview! And I love to love to interviewer!

[Helga](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/helga): Helga Davis and her guests have these deep conversations that inspire me to slow down, take notice of where I am, and think deep about myself.

[You Can't Say That!](https://broadwaypodcastnetwork.com/podcast/you-cant-say-that/): Tonya Pinkins interviews guests about theatre, Hollywood, spirituality, and discusses the racism and sexism she has faced. I highly reccomend [this essay she wrote in July 2020](https://medium.com/@tonyapinkins/why-i-am-fed-up-with-performative-activism-from-white-and-black-theater-makers-d46564ec94fe).

[What Makes You Sing](https://foreverdogpodcasts.com/podcasts/what-makes-u-sing/): Larry Owens speaks with theatre and comedy people about their lives through the lens of the songs that made them. As songs bubble up from guests' memories, accompanist James Harvey follows on piano for these magical spontaneous performances. I listen for Owens' effervesce, and his indelible singing is a such a balm.

[Frontiers of Commoning](https://www.bollier.org/blog/announcing-new-podcast-frontiers-commoning): David Bollier has written so much about *The Commons* and cooperative movements. It is wonderful to hear him speak with people about their projects!

## If you're a New Yorker
Or even if you're not, you may enjoy these!

[FAQNYC](https://faq.nyc/): Truly essential for all New Yorkers to listen to this weekly recap on New York news, and interviews with reporters, politicians, artists, and activists.

[Borrowed](https://www.bklynlibrary.org/podcasts): The Brooklyn Public Library's podcast tells stories of Brooklyn, examines the history and role of the library, and illustrates why libraries are truly the best institution.

[Second Avenues Sagas Podcast](http://secondavenuesagas.com/category/podcast/): Benjamin Kabak writes about the subway and New York City transit with a brilliant understanding of its past and present. I love hearing him speak with experts, and at the very least you should read whatever his latest writings are.

## Stories

[Hit Play](http://www.nyneofuturists.org/) is from the New York Neo-Futurists, my absolute favorite theatre company in the world have been making a podcast since March that is funny and touching and experimental and wacky and makes me feel wonderful inside.

[The Topical](https://www.theonion.com/c/the-topical) from The Onion is a satire of daily news podcasts. It plays with the form of news podcasts and is mostly hysterical and so rediculous I am astounded by the brilliant writing. I do sometimes grimace in discomfort at jokes, and wonder who the writing staff is, and if it's a homogenous group of people.

[National Lampoon Radio Hour: the podcast](https://www.nationallampoon.com/podcasts/radio-hour/). This podcast features stellar comedians (Cole Escola and Jo Firestone!!!) and hilarious sketches. Give it a listen :) and please send me anything you know like it.

## etc thoughts

These podcasts mostly in some way *institutionalized* or produced in the scope of a larger organization. I imagine that podcast networks are helpful for handling podcast infrustructure, advertising, and providing equipment/design.

Spotify/Luminary do have podcasts that are exclusive to their platform, different from what I describe above. One would *stream* those audio files rather than have the same agency one has when downloading. I hope that a majority of podcasts stick with the RSS model.

A number of podcasts have the premise of two friends chatting. And it can be difficult to *get into* the podcast if it doesn't feel like you're in their friend group. I wish every podcast had a sort of *keystone episode* that would enable you to pick up on jokes, who the hosts are, and their deal!
