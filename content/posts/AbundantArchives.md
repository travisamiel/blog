## Missing You
As I so deeply miss the uncomfortable, subversive, movement-driven, messy performances I came to NYC for, I have felt eccestatic by recordings which have popped up that I didn't know existed. But the urgency to watch in a specific window, a limitation for the number of viewers, or cost have all felt like undue artificial restrictions.

Many have long offered robust, deep archives of their workâ€”which I'd like to celebrate. Here are two pairs that exemplify what I would like to see more of. Perhaps I'll add more to this list in the future.

## Organizations
[The Chocolate Factory's](https://chocolatefactorytheater.org/) Vimeo is a pantheon of *stellar* full-length performances.

[Roulette](https://roulette.org/) an archive that's experitially designed to feel the scope of their decades of experimental intramedium (interdisciplinary? multidisciplinary? multimedia?) archives.

## Individuals
Praise be to [Reza Abdoh's archivist Adam Soch](https://vimeopro.com/adamsoch/reza-abdoh), for capturing these problematic performance collages.

[Miguel Guitierez](https://vimeo.com/miguelgutierrez71) has his disography of queer choreographies online in a way that demonstrates his ourve so beautifully.

## MY convinction
Recordings should remain free to watch. It should be the goal of arts institutions that have a 501 (c)(3) status to remove as many barriers to access to what they produce so that it may reach the largest possible [target] audience. What are the barriers and who is the audience? Great questions to ask always!
