A lot of my time has been spent in video calls. [This blog post](https://aspirationtech.org/blog/virtualmeetingpowerdynamics) titled 'Power Dynamics and Inclusion in Virtual Meetings' reminds me of the multitudes of ways people come to technology. We all have different needs and understandings regarding the way our world, infrustructure, and platforms work.

[Since the end of May](https://twitter.com/search?q=(from%3Aheytravistravis)%20until%3A2020-07-09%20since%3A2020-05-30%20-filter%3Areplies&src=typed_query), I've been retweeting-as-expression vis-Ã -vis abolition, systemic + institutional oppression, racism, transphobia, decolonization, sexual assult, and journaling about it. I'm making a private action plan that lays out what I'm doing and what I would like to do.

[This diagram of 'contradictions for white people in racial justice work'](https://www.instagram.com/p/CBhJwWIlmdw/) articulates a lot in my head. It brings some optismism back into my spirit when I think my purpose ought to be fighting for the improvement of institutions I've been in, rather than quitting them. I also felt quite grateful reading [coverage for this plan for reopening made by roller derby people](https://www.wired.com/story/womens-roller-derby-has-a-plan-for-covid-and-it-kicks-ass/) which was detailed, praised, based in data, coming from a centralized source, and specific to the derby community needs.
