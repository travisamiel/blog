A thing that ~~theatremakers~~ people who put on plays often ask is "why this play, why now".

Livestreaming (whether via Zoom, Facebook, YouTube) feels like the most analgous option for live performance while this isn't possible. But there's   I'd like "why this _live_ now".

Will the audience gain something by being there together digitally?

So much, too much can go wrong when you livestream, and the quality is worse. Please, consider the best medium for what you're making.

If it's a conversation between two people, we probably just need the audioâ€”maybe put some photos on the internet alongside it?
