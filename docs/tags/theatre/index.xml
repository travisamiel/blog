      <description>Missing You As I so deeply miss the uncomfortable, subversive, movement-driven, messy performances I came to NYC for, I have felt eccestatic by recordings which have popped up that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know existed. But the urgency to watch in a specific window, a limitation for the number of viewers, or cost have all felt like undue artificial restrictions.
Many have long offered robust, deep archives of their workâ€”which I&amp;rsquo;d like to celebrate.</description>

      <description>A quesiton that theatremakers people who put on plays often ask is &amp;ldquo;why this play, why now&amp;rdquo;.
Livestreaming (whether via a video call, or just to Facebook or YouTube) feels like the most analgous form for performers to work in while congregating isn&amp;rsquo;t possible, so when producing something consider: &amp;ldquo;why this live now&amp;rdquo;?
Will the audience gain something by being there as it is made? Will what is being made change because of the audience?</description>
