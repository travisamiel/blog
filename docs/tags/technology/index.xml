      <description>A lot of my time has been spent in video calls. This blog post titled &amp;lsquo;Power Dynamics and Inclusion in Virtual Meetings&amp;rsquo; reminds me of the multitudes of ways people come to technology. We all have different needs and understandings regarding the way our world, infrustructure, and platforms work.
Since the end of May, I&amp;rsquo;ve been retweeting-as-expression vis-à-vis abolition, systemic + institutional oppression, racism, transphobia, decolonization, sexual assult, and journaling about it.</description>

      <description>decoupling togetherness with real life
 I think I heard this as a quote somewhere, but I am not sure where.
While I&amp;rsquo;m reminding myself not to put any pressure of productivity on myself, I still enjoy making, expressing myself, experimenting, and playing as an activity. Rather than translating what I&amp;rsquo;d do in a theatre to a livestream, I&amp;rsquo;d like to talk about digital tools that build upon the skills I have as a performance artist.</description>

      <description>Sometimes I wake in the middle of the night thinking I&amp;rsquo;ve figured out exactly how to make this blog perfect.
Right now I like that it&amp;rsquo;s built on Hugo and that it most importantly lives in little Markdown files that I own in a simple format and if I want to change the theme or host the blog somewhere else I can do that without any problems.
But then I come across a site like this https://wiki.</description>

      <description>I deeply love Lifehacker&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;How I Work&amp;rsquo; series, and wanted to write my own recap of the software &amp;amp; platforms I love.
My goal is to use as much open-source software, and after reading this series on Gizmodo, I&amp;rsquo;m wondering how I can utilize platforms that don&amp;rsquo;t have nefarious goals—I&amp;rsquo;m not perfect at all.
My essentials *Firefox for web browsing, and I search with Duck Duck Go.
Evernote is my extension of the brain, where everything is stored.</description>

      <title>Why this live, why now</title>

      <description>A quesiton that theatremakers people who put on plays often ask is &amp;ldquo;why this play, why now&amp;rdquo;.
Livestreaming (whether via a video call, or just to Facebook or YouTube) feels like the most analgous form for performers to work in while congregating isn&amp;rsquo;t possible, so when producing something consider: &amp;ldquo;why this live now&amp;rdquo;?
Will the audience gain something by being there as it is made? Will what is being made change because of the audience?</description>
