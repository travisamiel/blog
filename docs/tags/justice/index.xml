      <description>The Fast Feeling depressed recently, I&amp;rsquo;m markedly taking a social media fast—and even just like staying off all news during the day, but just for a smidgey. I&amp;rsquo;m still following my morning ritual of Digestable, Democracy Now, and the Broadway Briefing. I don&amp;rsquo;t like being off Twitter, since it is by scrolling I come across perspectives that shift my own.
For example this piece from Belgrade Theatre Coventry writing about why the organization will stop using umbrella terms for non-white people such as POC and BAME.</description>

      <description>A lot of my time has been spent in video calls. This blog post titled &amp;lsquo;Power Dynamics and Inclusion in Virtual Meetings&amp;rsquo; reminds me of the multitudes of ways people come to technology. We all have different needs and understandings regarding the way our world, infrustructure, and platforms work.
Since the end of May, I&amp;rsquo;ve been retweeting-as-expression vis-à-vis abolition, systemic + institutional oppression, racism, transphobia, decolonization, sexual assult, and journaling about it.</description>
