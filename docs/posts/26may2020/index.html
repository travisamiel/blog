<p>decoupling togetherness with real life</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think I heard this as a quote somewhere, but I am not sure where.</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;m reminding myself not to put any pressure of productivity on myself, I still enjoy making, expressing myself, experimenting, and playing as an activity. Rather than translating what I&rsquo;d do in a theatre to a livestream, I&rsquo;d like to talk about digital tools that build upon the skills I have as a performance artist. With them, I&rsquo;m still using all the things I love: words, sound, color, images, movement, humor, story, character, etc to create an experience.</p>
<p>Some projects I&rsquo;ve played around with come into the form of a podcast, animated video, game, or interactive story-experience.</p>
<p>Using digital tools presents some additional opportunities to moult traditional notions of roles by enabling stronger collaboration and iteration of what we make. <a href="https://howlround.com/techne-1">Gwydion Suilebhan wrote of this back in 2013 on HowlRound in a series I just love</a>.</p>
<p>Below are some platforms I recommend and my sense of how complicated on a scale from 1 - 5&hellip;one being like a Word document and five being &ldquo;you need use JavaScript&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="anchor-a-podcast-maker-on-your-phone">Anchor, a podcast maker on your phone</h2>
<p>With this app you can easily record and edit podcasts that get syndicated to all of the places people get podcasts. I have some hesitations about this platform now that it&rsquo;s owned by Spotify. But, it&rsquo;s just the most seamless experience to create and distribute. You can have people send you little audio missives, it has built in underscoring music, sound effects, and simple editing tools.</p>
<h1 id="storytelling">Storytelling</h1>
<p>Check out <a href="https://twinery.org/">Twinery</a>, which I would put at a 2 or 3.</p>
<h2 id="animating">Animating</h2>
<p><a href="wickeditor.com">WickEditor</a> is a total 3, in that you are presented with a canvas, simple tools, and a timeline. After watching some of the video tutorials, it&rsquo;s straightforward to start making animations</p>
<h2 id="games-making">Games Making</h2>
<p>WickEditor can also make simple games! Check out this piece I made on <a href="travisamiel.com/imworried">WickEditor</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to have some tight technical requirements, but the ability to make layered, complicated, GameBoy-esq games, you&rsquo;ve got to check out <a href="https://www.gbstudio.dev/">GB Studio</a>, which is what I&rsquo;m using to create the</p>
<h1 id="a-five">A Five</h1>
<p><a href="glitch.com">Glitch</a> is a platform that instantly deploys web sites and apps, built around whole community of technically savvy makers.</p>
