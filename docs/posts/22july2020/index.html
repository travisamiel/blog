			<h2 id="the-fast">The Fast</h2>
<p>Feeling depressed recently, I&rsquo;m markedly taking a social media fastâ€”and even just like staying off all news during the day, but just for a smidgey. I&rsquo;m still following my morning ritual of Digestable, Democracy Now, and the Broadway Briefing. I don&rsquo;t like being off Twitter, since it is by scrolling I come across perspectives that shift my own.</p>
<p>For example this piece from <a href="https://www.belgrade.co.uk/stories/a-statement-on-eradicating-the-use-of-the-term-bame/">Belgrade Theatre Coventry writing about why the organization will stop using umbrella terms for non-white people such as POC and BAME</a>. I want to absorb lots of different perspectives on this like what do people who advocated for this think, are White people enthusiastic, are other institutions doing the same?</p>
<p>And as another example, <a href="https://www.a11yproject.com/">this resource on digital accessibility</a>, I wanna be connected with people on it! And yet â€” as I always remind myself â€” I don&rsquo;t need to be on Twitter/Instagram/Facebook to be connected with people. I can chat with strangers in forums! I can connect with my friends on the phone!</p>
<h2 id="confession">Confession</h2>
<p>I abandoned the pickles I was fermenting. Thankfully I&rsquo;ve found a place in NYC to drop off food scraps to be composted!!</p>
<h2 id="the-feast">The Feast</h2>
<p>The kombucha brewing is going <em>well</em>. I made a lemon-rosemary flavored bottle that had a nice fizz and was enjoyable. But there&rsquo;s something about the constant exposure to the smell of fermenting black tea that I feel over the past months has diminished the craving which initated this whole endeavour. Life truly is about the journey and not the destination&hellip;folks in a kombucha Facebook group declare their increased cravings after getting into brewing&hellip;.</p>
