      <description>I am making kombucha. (a SCOBY from a neighbor + black tea)
I am making pickles. (cucumbers in a jar with salt)
After more than a week of letting each vessle do it&amp;rsquo;s thing, I moved the jar of kombucha into a bottle (for the second stage of brewing), and I ate a what can now be called a pickle.
The kombucha was flat and still too sweet. The pickle was mushy, and not quite bitter.</description>

      <title>Why this live, why now</title>

      <description>A quesiton that theatremakers people who put on plays often ask is &amp;ldquo;why this play, why now&amp;rdquo;.
Livestreaming (whether via a video call, or just to Facebook or YouTube) feels like the most analgous form for performers to work in while congregating isn&amp;rsquo;t possible, so when producing something consider: &amp;ldquo;why this live now&amp;rdquo;?
Will the audience gain something by being there as it is made? Will what is being made change because of the audience?</description>
